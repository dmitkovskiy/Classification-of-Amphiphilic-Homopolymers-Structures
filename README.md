# Deep Learning Based Classification of Amphiphilic Homopolymers Structures
## Introduction
The possibility of creating particles with specific surface properties through relatively simple operations has resulted in a growing demand for spherical nanoparticles with grafted polymer chains across numerous scientific and industrial fields. These include the oil industry and the production of nanocomposites, as well as biomedical applications.

In accordance with the aim of the paper, we examined a spherical nanoparticle of radius R, decorated by M macromolecules with N amphiphilic monomer units. The amphiphilic monomer units embody both solvophobic and solvophilic groups and are represented as A-graft-B "dumbbells," consisting of two beads with a diameter σ. The beads A are linked together, forming the chain backbone, while beads B serve as freely rotating side pendants (Fig. 1). The macromolecules are softly grafted onto the nanoparticle surface in the sense that the attachment points - A beads of the first monomer units of grafted macromolecules - are located in a thin ~ σ near-surface layer and are capable of moving freely along the nanoparticle surface. The decorated nanoparticle is immersed in a selective solvent, which is athermal for the main chain A groups and poor for the pendant B groups.
